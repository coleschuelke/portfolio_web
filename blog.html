                        It's a way of keeping myself honest and focused. What I write here should be first and foremost an unbiased catalog of things I've done, things I think about, things I care about.
                        It's not *for* anyone else. It shouldn't be a facade or a front that I expect to garner a certain reaction. It should be a documentation of who I am. 
                        Who I am when no one is watching. Now I will make it public only because I find that there is often value in shared perspective. And so if I can provide some of that perspective,
                        if someone can learn from my failures and my successes, then maybe I can make the world a little bit better. Even if it's just by being an example of what not to do.
                        But if at any point the focus of these posts turns towards impressing or formulating a certain, desired image of myself, the honesty will be lost. 
                        As soon as that happens, I will cease to write here. 
                        So that is to say that the goal of this page is to act as a passive witness to my life. If you have found it and appreciate it, I am glad that my life has been of value, but know that I am not doing it for you.
                        Whether or not these words are read is of no consequence to me. I will strive to maintain my integrity and live a life that I can be proud of, whether anyone else cares or not. 
                        With that disclaimer, I will leave the rest of these entries to you, to do with them as you please.</p></div>
