                                I dream big, but I firmly believe that who you are is much more important than what you do.
                                These are some words that describe who I am. </p>

                        <p class="description" id="intent-desc">I firmly believe in the necessity for intentionality. 
                            Every opportunity is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and every second wasted is a second you will never get back. 
                            But do not mistake intentionality for productivity. Well-placed rest and fun are just as, or even more important than, 
                            the things we apply ourselves to. …

                            It has the power to turn even the most radical failures into fuel that can propel us towards our goals. 
                            Growth maintains absolute dominance over disappointment, which can turn fault into progress

                            I feel a certain dissidence in taking things for granted. 
                            Curiosity is a carrot dangling in front of my face, always just out of reach, 
                            but always close enough for me to taste the sweetness of comprehension. (def needs to be reworked)

                            the littleness and the bigness of it. To be conscious of the smallest details of your own existence 
                            and to attend to them with a certain harmonic fervor.
