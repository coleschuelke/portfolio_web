                            <p>I am an engineering student who strives to improve every day, both in my field, and as a human being.
                                Inherently curious, I find it easy to dive into new projects and quickly get my hands dirty in any number of domains. 
                                I am meticulous and hold myself to high standards, resulting in thorough work which I combine with excellent communication skills to stay aligned with teammates and be as efficient as possible. 
                                I am always willing to contribute in any way that I can, but I am also capable of taking the lead and blending a structured approach with long-term vision to effectively spearhead projects.
                                I dream big, but I firmly believe that who you are is much more important than what you do.</p>
                                <p>Scroll over each word to see what it means to me.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2 class="word" id="intent">Intentionality</h2>

                        <p class="description" id="intent-desc">I firmly believe in the necessity for intentionality. 
                            Every opportunity is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and every second wasted is a second you will never get back. 
                            But don’t mistake intentionality for productivity. Well-placed rest and fun are just as, or even more important than, the things we might consider “productive.” 
                            Life is a balance, but balance isn’t accidental. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="act-desc">Activity fuels my vitality and clarity of thought. 
                            Through the physical world, and my participation in it, I find balance, strength, and endurance – qualities that allow me to stay focused and motivated in a fast-paced world. 
                            I love spending time in nature and I believe the outdoors keep me grounded, remind me of the beauty of all creation, and renews a sense of hunger to live in the moment. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="growth-desc">I see growth as a beautiful opportunity offered to us constantly. 
                            It has the power to turn even the most radical failures into fuel that can propel us towards our goals. 
                            Growth maintains absolute dominance over disappointment, which can turn fault into progress as long as we are able to perceive ourselves and the world with honesty and ambition.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="curious-desc">Learning is my lifeblood – an endless pursuit to satiate my thirst for knowledge and understanding. 
                            I don’t like to take things for granted. 
                            Curiosity is what keeps me focused in and out of the classroom and I honestly feel lucky to have this source of motivation, since it makes every day exciting – there is always something to learn.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="create-desc">Creativity is a matter of perspective. Creativity is the highest end of agency. It is the way in which we apply our experience and understanding of the world in order to shape it. 
                            From creativity comes our ability to leave our own unique mark on the world - to give something of ourselves that will exist outside of us. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="aware-desc">Awareness is the root of meaning. To be aware is to acknowledge your own place in time and space – the littleness and the bigness of it. 
                            To be conscious of the small details of life, in my experience, opens the door to appreciation and satisfaction. 
                            In order to understand who we are and where we are going, we have to take the time to observe our surroundings.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="express-desc">To communicate is to share – time, thought, emotion – with the people you care for the most. 
                            If we never took the time to share pieces of ourselves with others, we couldn't progress - as a society or as individuals.
                            Music, photgraphy, philosohpical conversations... They are all activites that provide perspective and a very real sense of connection to the people with whom we share this world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description" id="humble-desc">Learning from others requires humility and yet it is the most important prerequisite to growth. 
                            You cannot grow if you cannot admit that there is still room to grow. Humility is also the key to collaboration. 
                            Taking the time to genuinely acknowledge others’ perspectives and ideas requires a belief that their idea might be better than yours. 
                            However when we set aside our pride and prioritize the project, everyone ends up ahead.
